# 2. Use Express

Date: 2020-11-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to build a web-based application in Node. Express is a minimal and
flexible framework that sets up a lot basic configuration for us like routing
and middleware, and makes it easy to incoporate the GOV UK design system UI
components.

## Decision

We will use Express as the basis for this project.

## Consequences

We won't need to reinvent the wheel and can get a web application up and
running quickly. Node and Express are common frameworks used at MOJ so will
make it easy for new developers to be onboarded to the project in future.
