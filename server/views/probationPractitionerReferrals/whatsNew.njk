      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get better information about sessions</h2>

      <p>
        We’ve made some changes to help you get better information about sessions in Refer and monitor an intervention.
        You’ll now be able to find out:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>if a session happened</li>
        <li>about sessions which did not happen but the person on probation attended, for example because the caseworker was absent</li>
        <li>if it’s not known if the person attended, for example it was a phone call and the service provider caseworker could not attend</li>
        <li>details about lateness, such as how late someone was and any reason they gave</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The service provider also has the option to outline what’s planned for the next session.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Give feedback on the changes</h2>
